        Trading Rules and Discipline for Quant Genie by QubiQ Technology
      </h1>
      <p class="mb-4">
        At Quant Genie, we believe that success in trading requires not only
        effective strategies but also strong discipline and adherence to clearly
        defined rules. Below are the key Trading Rules and Disciplines that all
        users are encouraged to follow to ensure consistent performance and
        effective risk management while trading.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">1. Trade with a Plan</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Objective:</strong> Always enter trades with a well-defined
        strategy.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Plan Structure:</strong> Your plan should include entry and
          exit points, risk tolerance, and position sizing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Backtesting:</strong> Ensure your trading plan is tested on
          historical data before execution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Follow the Plan:</strong> Stick to your pre-determined plan
          and avoid emotional decisions based on market movements.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">2. Risk Management</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Set Stop-Loss Levels:</strong> Protect your capital by setting
          a stop-loss for every trade. The maximum risk per trade should not
          exceed 2-5% of your trading capital.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Position Sizing:</strong> Adjust position sizes based on your
          risk tolerance and the volatility of the asset.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diversification:</strong> Do not put all your capital into a
          single trade or asset. Diversify your portfolio to mitigate risk.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">3. Control Emotions</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid Emotional Trading:</strong> Trading decisions must be
          made based on data and strategy, not fear, greed, or hope.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limit Overtrading:</strong> Stay disciplined by not
          overtrading, especially after a loss or a series of winning trades.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stick to a Routine:</strong> Maintain a consistent routine of
          analyzing the markets, making informed decisions, and following
          through with your strategy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">4. Time Your Trades</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Trade During Active Market Hours:</strong> Ensure you trade
          when the market is most liquid (typically during major market open
          hours).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid Overtrading:</strong> Only enter trades when your setup
          criteria are met. Do not force trades.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Breakout and Trend Continuation:</strong> Enter trades when
          there is confirmation of a trend or breakout. Avoid guessing market
          movements.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">
        5. Capital Preservation is Priority
      </h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Focus on Minimizing Losses:</strong> Your primary goal should
          be capital preservation rather than maximizing profit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gradual Growth:</strong> Aim for consistent, small gains
          rather than risking everything for a big win.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid Leverage Abuse:</strong> Use leverage cautiously, as it
          amplifies both potential gains and potential losses.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">
        6. Record and Review Trades
      </h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Maintain a Trading Journal:</strong> Record every trade with
          details like entry, exit, stop-loss, position size, and the reasoning
          behind the trade.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Review Performance:</strong> Regularly review past trades to
          identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learn from Mistakes:</strong> Focus on learning from past
          mistakes and refining your strategy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">7. Stay Informed</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Market Analysis:</strong> Stay updated with market news,
          economic reports, and geopolitical events that can impact asset
          prices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical and Fundamental Analysis:</strong> Use both
          technical indicators and fundamental analysis to form a comprehensive
          view of market conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">
        8. Avoid FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
      </h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Discipline Over Impulsiveness:</strong> Do not rush into
          trades because of the fear of missing out on potential profits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wait for Confirmation:</strong> Always wait for confirmation
          of your setup before entering trades. Do not enter trades based on
          hunches or incomplete signals.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">
        9. Adapt to Market Conditions
      </h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Flexible Strategies:</strong> The market can change, and so
          should your approach. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on the
          prevailing market conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bear and Bull Markets:</strong> Recognize whether you are in a
          bull or bear market and adapt your strategy accordingly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">10. Set Realistic Goals</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid Unrealistic Expectations:</strong> Set attainable profit
          targets and avoid being overly ambitious in the short term.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consistency Over Windfalls:</strong> Focus on steady,
          consistent growth rather than chasing high-risk trades that promise
          massive returns.
        </li>
      </ul>
